### Abstract
Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters all around the world, leading to an urgent need for access to reliable information about these hazards. 
It is an issue that is impacting a growing amount of people. This project aims to create a dynamic website that provides key information about real-time and past disasters. It will require proficiency in web development technologies, in particular web mapping, database theory and design and visual style of a web page. The goal is to develop a website that is user-friendly, visually beautiful, and instructive, and that shows geographic data regarding natural catastrophes in a secure and accessible manner so that it can aid future humanitarian and catastrophe relief operations.
